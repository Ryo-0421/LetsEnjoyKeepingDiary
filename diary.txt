	Hello, everyone. My name is Ryo. Just yesterday, I attended a workshop in my company regarding how to use Github, which is basically a tool to store programming data
As this is not the first time I used Github, the workshop was basically a review of what I always do with my PC.The thing, though, is we need to keep diaries to grasp the concept of Github, 
and in my view, It's a great idea to form the habit of something to get familialized with it.I could go and go about a bunch of pointless stuff, but this is the first diary I wrote,so I 'll finish it. 
I'l be making a little more effort to write  something better.
